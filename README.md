The evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is crucial for effective management and treatment of this condition.
In this project, a hybrid ensemble model was developed by combining decision tree classifier, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms to improve the accuracy of CKD diagnosis.
